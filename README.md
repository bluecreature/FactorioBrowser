# Factorio Browser

_(This is a work in progress which I started as a way to learn C# and .NET and not because of such browser being particularly
indispensable; it is not yet fully functional and it might never be)_

Factorio Browser is an item, recipe and technology browser for the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). It is similar to the
"[What is it used for?](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/MrDoomah/what-is-it-used-for)" mod, but this program doesn't require
Factorio to be running and so you can browse without having to worry about the pesky indigenous fauna while planning your latest
megabase.
